Deadbeef layout file and plugins for Ubuntu

Since it is a pain to build some of the plugins (Infobar, Musical Spectrum) and configure a nice UI, I have spend a few hours figuring it out for future use, mostly because I needed a music player with folder tree view support. For the old folks that have music collections without proper tags. 

Feel free to use it. Screenshot attached:
