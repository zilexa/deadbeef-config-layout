# deadbeef my config and layout, with folder tree view!

Deadbeef layout file and plugins for Ubuntu

Since it is a pain to build some of the plugins (Infobar, Musical Spectrum) and configure a nice UI, I have spend a few hours figuring it out for future use, mostly because I needed a music player with folder tree view support. For the old folks that have music collections without proper tags. 

Feel free to use it. 
copy the config file to: $HOME/.config/deadbeef/
copy the lib folder to: $HOME/.local/
start Deadbeef.

On Ubuntu Budgie 20.04.1 with standard Pocillo theme:

The colourful wave spectrum background matches the dark theme of Arc-Dark. Enable that theme via: 
  Budgie Menu > Budgie Desktop Settings > Widgets: Select Pocillo-Dark or Arc-Dark.
If you prefer the white spectrum background in DeadBeef: > Right click the wave spectrum > Configure > Background (top right) > Choose white. 

Note lyrics & music info is available via the Infobar plugin, which is compiled (gtk3) and included however it crashes the whole player regularly. The last version is from 2013. I don't recommend using it but you can go to View > Design mode, add/remove UI parts to add it.
